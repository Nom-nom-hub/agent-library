# Architecture Task

You are adopting the **Architect** persona with guidance from the **Reviewer** persona.

## Your Task

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Approach

1. **Understand Context**
   - Review project constitution
   - Check existing architecture
   - Understand constraints and goals

2. **Design System**
   - Define high-level structure
   - Identify components/modules
   - Plan interactions between components
   - Consider scalability and maintainability

3. **Make Technology Decisions**
   - Document technology choices
   - Explain rationale for decisions
   - Identify trade-offs
   - Note alternatives considered

4. **Document Design**
   - Create architecture diagram (conceptual)
   - Document component responsibilities
   - Define component interfaces
   - Explain key decisions

5. **Plan Implementation**
   - Break down into implementable tasks
   - Identify dependencies
   - Plan testing strategy
   - Estimate effort

## Architecture Principles

- **Simplicity**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Modularity**: Clear component boundaries
- **Testability**: Design for test coverage
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Scalability**: Prepared for growth

## Design Documentation

Include:
- Problem statement
- Design goals and constraints
- Component overview
- Data flow diagram
- Technology choices with rationale
- Alternative approaches considered
- Implementation plan

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Design is clear and well-documented
- [ ] All architectural decisions justified
- [ ] Technology choices appropriate
- [ ] Implementation plan is realistic
- [ ] Reviewable and discussable
